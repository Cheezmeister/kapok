Overview
--------

**Kapok** is a simple, static(ish) collapsible tree generator for JS objects (and by extension, JSON). It aims to be easy to use for both developers and end-users, but reasonably flexible where applicable.

It looks something like this:

![screenshot](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f9eb362e14f9c1cbf2d4a04c00fb735fdaafaa70/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f6548716c5578662e706e67)

It was written in about a week while recovering from an expensive appendectomy, because I needed something like it and couldn't find anything satisfactory from the googles. As such it is a bit immature and probably has holes here and there, but it has tested stable on most modern browsers.


Installation
------------

The recommended way to use Kapok is to simply drop `[kapok.js]` and `[kapok-full.css]` into your source tree and include them however you please.

If you don't like the default styling or cannot override it to your satisfaction, use `[kapok-core.css]` instead, which has the bare minimum CSS for expand/collapse behaviour.

[kapok.js]: https://github.com/Cheezmeister/kapok/releases/download/v0.0.2-alpha/kapok.js
[kapok-full.css]: https://github.com/Cheezmeister/kapok/releases/download/v0.0.2-alpha/kapok-full.css
[kapok-core.css]: https://github.com/Cheezmeister/kapok/releases/download/v0.0.2-alpha/kapok-core.css

Usage
-----

```js
var someObject = {foo: 'bar'};
document.body.appendChild(kapok.render(someObject));
```

Server-side use is not supported as a DOM is assumed.

Kapok does not make use of UMD, AMD, or any other MD. Instead it takes a steaming dump on best practices and sticks its functionality into the global scope, because that's one less thing that might break a year from now when all the cool kids are using BBQMD instead. If you have a global var `kapok` that you don't want trampled, you should rename this module's references to it. Yes, all three of them.
